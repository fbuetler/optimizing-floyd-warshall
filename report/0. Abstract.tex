The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a widely used way of solving the all-pairs-shortest-path problem. Due to its popularity, much research has been done on ways to optimize the algorithm.
In addition, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is proven effective at solving a wide range of other problems, by simply replacing its input type and basic operations.

In this work, we implement several known optimization techniques on the all-pairs-shortest-path Floyd-Warshall, and confirm their effectiveness. We also implement these techniques on two other instances of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, namely transitive closure  and all-pairs-widest-path. We evaluate the optimizations on these two instances and confirm that they work on Floyd-Warshall instances beyond all-pairs-shortest-path.

Finally, we present an autotuner that empirically finds good parameters for several optimization strategies, and generates functional, optimized code for all three implementations.
