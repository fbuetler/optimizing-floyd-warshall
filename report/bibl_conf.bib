Experiments indicate that the blocked algorithm delivers a speedup (relative to the unblocked Floyd's algorithm) between 1.6 and 1.9 on a Sun Ultra Enterprise 4000/5000 for graphs that have between 480 and 3200 vertices. The measured speedup on an SGI O2 for graphs with between 240 and 1200 vertices is between 1.6 and 2.",

  abstract="In this chapter we concentrate on path problems in graphs. Typical examples are the problems of computing shortest or longest paths or computing the k shortest path between all pairs of points in a graph. The best known algorithms for these problems differ only slightly. In fact, they are all special cases of an algorithm for solving general path problems on graphs. General path problems over closed semi-rings and Kleene's algorithm for solving them are dealt with in section 1, special cases are then treated in section 2. The algebraic point of view allows us to formulate the connection between general path problems and matrix multiplication in an elegant way: Matrix multiplication in a semi-ring and solution of a general path problem have the same order of complexity. In section 4 we consider fast algorithms for multiplication of matrices over a ring. This is then applied to boolean matrices. Section 7 contains a lower bound on the complexity of boolean matrix product.",

  abstract="We propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for the solution of the all-pair shortest-path problem for directed and dense graphs with no negative cycles. We propose R-Kleene, a compact and in-place recursive algorithm inspired by Kleene's algorithm. R-Kleene delivers a better performance than previous algorithms for randomly generated graphs represented by highly dense adjacency matrices, in which the matrix components can have any integer value. We show that R-Kleene, unchanged and without any machine tuning, yields consistently between 1/7 and 1/2 of the peak performance running on five very different uniprocessor systems.",

abstract="Modern high performance computer systems continue to increase in size and complexity. Tools to measure application performance in these increasingly complex environments must also increase the richness of their measurements to provide insights into the increasingly intricate ways in which software and hardware interact. PAPI (the Performance API) has provided consistent platform and operating system independent access to CPU hardware performance counters for nearly a decade. Recent trends toward massively parallel multi-core systems with often heterogeneous architectures present new challenges for the measurement of hardware performance information, which is now available not only on the CPU core itself, but scattered across the chip and system. We discuss the evolution of PAPI into Component PAPI, or PAPI-C, in which multiple sources of performance data can be measured simultaneously via a common software interface. Several examples of components and component data measurements are discussed. We explore the challenges to hardware performance measurement in existing multi-core architectures. We conclude with an exploration of future directions for the PAPI interface.",
